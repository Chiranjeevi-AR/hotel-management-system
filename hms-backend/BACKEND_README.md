# Backend notes

This short note documents small, non-functional backend edits committed alongside frontend UI tweaks.

- Purpose: record that frontend UI improvements were made (CSS variables, button utilities, login accessibility).
- No API changes were made in this commit.
- Backend server port (local default): 8082 (see `src/main/resources/application.properties`).

If you want me to add a lightweight health endpoint (GET /actuator/health or /api/health) I can implement it and add tests — say the word and I'll proceed.
